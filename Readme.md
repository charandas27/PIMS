Placement and Internship Management System
Introduction

Securing a placement or internship is the ultimate goal for every student, envisioning themselves with a job in hand as they near the end of their college experience. For students, placements aren't merely about landing a job; they view it as a stepping stone toward shaping their future careers.
Motivation

Our goal through this project is to make the process of placements more joyous and beneficial for students, more functional for the faculty, and more convenient for the companies. We aim to develop a system that can manage student details and their progress, company details and their requirements, while also allowing the admin (Faculty) to closely monitor and provide support to the students and companies whenever necessary.
Review/Objective

    Student Management:
        Manage and display student details and progress (CGPA, backlogs, etc.)
        Students can upload their certificates, academic, and non-academic achievements.
        Only the companies that the students are eligible for, based on their CGPA and other criteria, will be visible in their list of companies to apply for.
    Company Interaction:
        Companies can see the overall performance of the college at a single glance.
        Companies can easily filter out their desired candidates.
        Companies can monitor students' growth and performance.
        Companies can also view and analyze projects done by the students.
    Faculty and Admin Functions:
        Faculty can view and manage the details of their students.
        Admin can maintain relations with the companies in a more effective manner.

Approach/Methodology
User Interface (UI)

    Frontend Development:
        The user interface is built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        Statistics and charts will be shown using Google Charts.

Backend Infrastructure

    Database Management:
        The storage of data and retrieval are managed using relational databases.

Other Required Technologies

    File Uploading:
        Technologies like Multer (Node.js) or Django FileField (Django) will be used for uploading files and attachments.
    Feedback Collection:
        Google Forms will be used for taking feedback and collecting any other necessary details.

Conclusion

Through this system, the 100+ companies that come to recruit students and the 2000+ students of our college will have an easy medium through which they can communicate effectively. This portal will help students be more self-sufficient and have a clear view of the opportunities and possibilities that lie before them. By reducing the human load and shifting most of the heavy lifting towards the system, we aim to create a simple yet effective website for easy access to all end users. Our goal is to make the placement process a pleasant and enjoyable experience through an interactive and engaging website.
